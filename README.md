1. REQUIREMENTS: 

Title: ECommerce Website â€“ Virtual electronics store. 
Name: A-Tech.

--> The site will be composed of several pages: 
- the main page, which will contain several categories of products.

--> The customer will be able to interact with the site, create an account and purchase, inspect, etc. products. The site will have facilities to make navigation on it as pleasant as possible. 

2. SPECIFICATIONS: 

--> Languages used (update): Initially, I used HTML + CSS for the site/front-end, but then I decided to move it to PHP, to make it easier for me to implement some functions for the back-end; MYSQL for the database. 
--> I also used: SCSS to automate the "style.css" file, Owl Carousel 2 for some design details, Font Awesome for choosing text style, nodejs + bootstrap + jquery + ajax + jsdelivr for the implementation of some business logics within the project, in Java Script.
--> To access the website and database I used xampp.
